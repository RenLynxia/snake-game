Snake Game with SDL2

reqrutiment library
1. GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
2. SDL2 Library
3. SDL2_ttf Library
4. SDL2_mixer Library

Because I included fonts and some sound effects, you also need to include them in the same folder as the existing code.

 ── snake_game_whit_C
    ├── arial.ttf
    ├── eat.wav
    ├── snake_game_whit_C.c
    ├── gameover.wav
    └── snake_game_sdl

Compilation Steps
Open your terminal and type this command:

1. gcc snake_game_whit_C.c -o snake_game -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf -lSDL2_mixer

2. ./snake_game_sdl

During Gameplay:

Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake.

Press ESC if you want to exit the game.

Press ESC to go back to the main menu or exit.

i just add the screenshot of some step to play game but for next step i will add another language
